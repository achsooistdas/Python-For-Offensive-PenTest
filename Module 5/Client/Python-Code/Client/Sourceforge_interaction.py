when you connect to an ssh server at the first time, if the ssh server keys are not stored on the client side, you will get a warning
message saying that the server keys are not chached in the system and will promopt whether you want to accecpt those keys.

since we do an automation on the target side, we inform paramiko to accept these keys for the first time without interrupting the session or
prompting the user and this done via > set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy()
